This report presents a detailed methodology for EmoNet-XAI, the first-place solution developed by SmolLab\_SEU for the "Fragments of Feeling" Kaggle competition. The framework is built upon the RoBERTa-Large transformer model and introduces a synergistic combination of advanced fine-tuning techniques, a robust evaluation strategy, and a commitment to model transparency. Key innovations include the implementation of Layer-wise Learning Rate Decay (LLRD) for stable and effective optimization, a 5-fold stratified cross-validation ensemble to enhance generalization and reduce variance, and the integration of eXplainable AI (XAI) using SHAP for model interpretability. This meticulously engineered pipeline achieved a final Macro F1-Score of 0.63064767 on the private leaderboard, securing the top rank.
